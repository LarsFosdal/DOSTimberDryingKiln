# P4 Timber Drying Kiln Process Controller
Timber drying kiln software w/ Borland Pascal 7.0 source

See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXSoBBbCIT0 for demo

Source was released to me by ABB Alfsen og Gunderson AS - who I originally rewrote the software for between 1986 and 1993

Fun bits:  
- My code for interrupt driven serial port comms
- My code for a GUI frontend for DOS programs
- OOP drivers for matrix printers
- OOP drivers for a number of different PLCs 
- My "hypertext" help system with a compiler that validates the help text and creates a binary version
- My custom bitmap fonts
- My total abuse of UPPERCASE keywords.  Syntax colors was not yet common.
- The extremely sparse commenting
